# Analysis of Third-Party Tracking in Mobile Phones 
The open-source application was developed using R Shiny and several R packages for the visualizations including:

• Highcharter: used to generate the interactive world map on the “dashboard” tab

• Plotly: used to make the ggplot objects interactive. It allows users to zoom in on certain points on charts and hover to see values.

• Ggplot2: common package used to build charts and graphs

• Rworldmap: used in combination with highcharter to build the map

• Rsconnect: used to deploy the application so it would be available online.

• Shinydashboard: this package was used to get the skin and finctionality of a dashboard. It uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS to develop objects

The application was deployed online using shiny.io and could be accessed at https://daz101.shinyapps.io/trackers/

The purpose of this work is to explore the prevalence of third-party trackers in the mobile ecosystem. Two data sets were analyzed that observed third-party domains by country, genre and trackers on the web. Prevalent and prominent trackers on the web were also considered to assess which companies were capable of cross-device tracking. The results indicate that the flow of data to third-parties have implications for users and online privacy policy and regulation.
